# 🧠 AI Terminal Project Generator 🚀

Welcome to the **AI Terminal Project Generator** — a smart terminal powered by multiple LLMs that helps you **build full-stack projects** and **run system commands** directly from your terminal.

## ✨ Features

- 🔌 **Multi-LLM Support** (Gemini, OpenAI, Llama, Cohere, Anthropic)
- 💬 Natural language command interface
- 🏗️ Auto-generates full-stack project scaffolds
- ⚙️ Executes terminal/system commands directly via AI
- 📁 Fully extensible and modular agent architecture

---

## 🤖 How It Works

1. **Choose your preferred LLM** at startup.
2. Interact with the AI using natural language prompts like:
   - `"Create a full-stack Next.js + MongoDB project"`
   - `"Create Simple React Application"`

3. The AI:
   - Plans and thinks through the request
   - Uses tools (code generation, shell command execution, API calls)
   - Iterates through `plan → action → observe → output → final `
   - Displays the final result in your terminal

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone "LINK"
cd ai-terminal-project-generator
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or `.venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file and add your API keys:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
# Add others as needed
```

### 5. Run the App
```bash
python main.py
```

## 👨‍💻 Contributing

Pull requests and issues are welcome! If you’d like to add support for a new LLM or tool, just fork the repo and submit a PR.

---

## 🛡️ Disclaimer

This tool has the ability to run shell/system commands — use responsibly, especially when running unverified queries.

---

## 💬 Example Prompt Ideas

- `"Generate a full-stack app with Express.js backend and React frontend"`
- `"Add Docker support to this project"`
- `"Create a login page with session-based auth"`
- `"Run: git init && git add . && git commit -m 'init'"`
